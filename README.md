 Sprint 5 Task 1.- Sampling Methods

## *Statement*

Learn how to perform data mining with Python.
Level 1
- Exercise 1

Get a set of sports-themed data that you like. Perform a data sampling generating a simple random sample and a systematic sample.

> **Simple random sample:**
In a simple random sample, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. Your sampling frame should include the whole population.
To conduct this type of sampling, you can use tools like random number generators or other techniques that are based entirely on chance.

> **Systematic sampling:**
Systematic sampling is similar to simple random sampling, but it is usually slightly easier to conduct. Every member of the population is listed with a number, but instead of randomly generating numbers, individuals are chosen at regular intervals.

Level 2

- Exercise 2

Continue with the set of sports-themed data and generate a stratified sample and a sample using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

> **Stratified sampling:**
Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into subpopulations that may differ in important ways. It allows you draw more precise conclusions by ensuring that every subgroup is properly represented in the sample.
To use this sampling method, you divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant characteristic (e.g. gender, age range, income bracket, job role).
Based on the overall proportions of the population, you calculate how many people should be sampled from each subgroup. Then you use random or systematic sampling to select a sample from each subgroup.

> **Oversampling using SMOTE:**
In SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) we synthesize elements for the minority class, in the vicinity of already existing elements.

Level 3

- Exercise 3

Continue with the set of sports data and generate a sample using the Reservoir sampling method.

> **Reservoir Sampling:**
In SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) we synthesize elements for the minority class, in the vicinity of already existing elements.
