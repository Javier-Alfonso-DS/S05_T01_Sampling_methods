It allows you draw more precise conclusions by ensuring that every subgroup is properly represented in the sample. To use this sampling method, you divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant characteristic (e.g. gender, age range, income bracket, job role). Based on the overall proportions of the population, you calculate how many people should be sampled from each subgroup. Then you use random or systematic sampling to select a sample from each subgroup."

It doesn't matter what the actual random_state number is 42, 0, 21, ... The important thing is that everytime you use 42, you will always get the same output the first time you make the split. This is useful if you want reproducible results, for example in the documentation, so that everybody can consistently see the same numbers when they run the examples. In practice I would say, you should set the random_state to some fixed number while you test stuff, but then remove it in production if you really need a random (and not a fixed) split.\n",
