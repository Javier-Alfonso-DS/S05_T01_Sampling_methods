It allows you draw more precise conclusions by ensuring that every subgroup is properly represented in the sample. To use this sampling method, you divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant characteristic (e.g. gender, age range, income bracket, job role). Based on the overall proportions of the population, you calculate how many people should be sampled from each subgroup. Then you use random or systematic sampling to select a sample from each subgroup."

        "SMOTE or Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is an oversampling technique but SMOTE working differently than your typical oversampling.\n",
        "In a classic oversampling technique, the minority data is duplicated from the minority data population. While it increases the number of data, it does not give any new information or variation to the machine learning model.\n",

        "For the reason above, Nitesh Chawla, et al. (2002) introduce a new technique to create synthetic data for oversampling purposes in their SMOTE paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "SMOTE works by utilizing a k-nearest neighbour algorithm to create synthetic data. SMOTE first start by choosing random data from the minority class, then k-nearest neighbours from the data are set. Synthetic data would then be made between the random data and the randomly selected k-nearest neighbour. Let me show you the example below.\n",

        "If you use random_state=some_number, then you can guarantee that the output of Run 1 will be equal to the output of Run 2, i.e. your split will be always the same. It doesn't matter what the actual random_state number is 42, 0, 21, ... The important thing is that everytime you use 42, you will always get the same output the first time you make the split. This is useful if you want reproducible results, for example in the documentation, so that everybody can consistently see the same numbers when they run the examples. In practice I would say, you should set the random_state to some fixed number while you test stuff, but then remove it in production if you really need a random (and not a fixed) split.\n",

        "------- \n",
        "**Reservoir sampling** is a family of randomized algorithms for choosing a simple random sample, without replacement, of k items from a population of unknown size n in a single pass over the items. The size of the population n is not known to the algorithm and is typically too large for all n items to fit into main memory. The population is revealed to the algorithm over time, and the algorithm cannot look back at previous items. At any point, the current state of the algorithm must permit extraction of a simple random sample without replacement of size k over the part of the population seen so far.\n",
